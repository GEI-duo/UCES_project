\section{Project Milestones}

The project needs to be done between the 19th of October 2024 and the 13th of January 2025. We identify five main features that need to be developed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Game Design
    \item MQTT Broker
    \item Meeple
    \item Operation base
    \item Master
\end{itemize}
    
All the tasks, subtasks, time estimations and dependencies are shown in the Gantt chart in Figure \ref{fig:gantt}.

Regarding the asignations, the \textit{Game Design}, \textit{Master} and \textit{MQTT Broker} are going to be done by all members of the different teams. Then, each team is responsible of programming their \textit{Meeple} and \textit{Operation base}.  In our case, Christian will do the \textit{Meeple} and Jordi will do the \textit{Operation base}.

Finally, we are going to expose the MQTT Broker in a public server in order to test the communication between the devices of all the groups remotely.
